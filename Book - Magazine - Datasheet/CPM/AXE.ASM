;this is a sample cold start loader, which, when 
;modified
;resides on track 00, sector 01 (the first sector on the 
;diskette), we assume that the controller has loaded 
;this sector into memory upon system start-up (this 
;program can be keyed-in, or can exist in read-only 
;memory
;beyond the address space of the cp/m version you are 
;running). the cold start loader brings the cp/m system 
;into memory at"loadp" (3400h +"bias"). in a 20k 
;memory system, the value of"bias" is 000h, with 
;large
;values for increased memory sizes (see section 2). 
;after
;loading the cp/m system, the cold start loader 
;branches
;to the "boot" entry point of the bios, which begins at
; "bios" +"bias". the cold start loader is not used un-
;til the system is powered up again, as long as the bios 
;is not overwritten. the origin is assumed at 0000h, and 
;must be changed if the controller brings the cold start 
;loader into another area, or if a read-only memory 
;area
;is used.
